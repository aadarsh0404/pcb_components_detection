# Pcb Components Detection

## Version 1
#### In version 1, I am able to detect ICs from pcb


## Version 2
#### In version 2, I am implementing yolov5 algorithm on a dataset having tiny objects which are divided into 5 classes as follows
##### boat
##### car
##### dock
##### jetski
##### lift

#### For training, I have used tiled dataset and trained the tiled dataset on image size scaled to 416 pixel.
#### For testing, I have used the COMPLETE image and scaled the image to 1024 pixels.
